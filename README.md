## 🏗️ Features
The priority-queue-simulation application offers a range of features to enhance your understanding of queuing systems:

1. **Multi-Teller Support:** Simulates multiple bank tellers serving customers.
2. **Priority Handling:** Executes customer service based on predefined priorities.
3. **Real-Time Visualization:** View how customers line up and get served in real-time.
4. **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust the arrival rate of customers and service times.
5. **Statistical Data:** Access detailed reports on waiting times and service efficiency.

## 📊 Understanding the Simulation
The goal of the priority-queue-simulation is to illustrate how different factors affect waiting times in a bank setting. You'll learn how:

- **Customer Priority:** High-priority customers get served first, changing the dynamics of the queue.
- **Service Rate:** How quickly tellers can serve customers impacts overall satisfaction.
- **Queue Length:** The application shows how varying numbers of customers changes wait times.

## ⚙️ How to Use the Application
Once the program is running, follow these steps to use it effectively:

1. **Select the Number of Tellers:** Choose how many tellers you want for your simulation.
2. **Set Customer Arrival Rate:** Decide how fast new customers arrive at the bank.
3. **Adjust Service Time:** Set how long each teller takes to process a customer.
4. **Start Simulation:** Click the "Start" button to begin your queue simulation.

## 📈 Analyzing Results
As the simulation runs, the application will display several metrics:

- **Average Waiting Time:** Understand how long customers wait before being served.
- **Total Customers Served:** See how many customers the tellers manage to serve in a given time.
- **Utilization Rate:** Get insights into how effectively tellers are operating.

## 💡 Tips for New Users
- Experiment with different parameters to see how they affect the queue's performance.
- Take notes on how varying elements influence customer experiences.
- Use the application as part of a project or study to deepen your understanding of queuing theory.
